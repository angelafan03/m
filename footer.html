          Are there specific institutions that are consistently applying or undertaking projects? 
          How can we visualize patterns in institutions? Is there a reason why one host country is applying to fund a project in another 
          archival country? Should we be encouraging countries to be their own host and archival country? Are there reasons why specific 
          countries are consistently funded while others arenâ€™t? Are there regions or countries that we want to see more applications from?
