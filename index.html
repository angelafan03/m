            <h2 id="expl">Exploratory Analysis and Questions</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              I decided to focus on the application data as I was more unsure of what I could do with the collection data.
              Others in the data lab seemed to have more ideas of how to clean up and visualize the collection data as well. 
              Some basic questions that arose from simply looking at the application data were which countries or regions were most represented, 
              whether there were large differences between host and archival countries, and how applications changed across cohorts 
              (were more, less, or the same countries applying). I also thought about patterns that might exist between material type and region. 
              I started off by using Tableau to create different types of visualizations for each cohort separately. 
              These included maps of host and archival countries, bar charts for applications that were funded and not funded by region, 
              bar charts for material types, and tables for host countries and the archival countries that they were applying to fund projects in.

             I also used Python and the Pandas library to get exact statistics of new countries that were present in each cohort 
             (the code is not the cleanest or most efficient).

            and seeing what everyone else had done, I decided to focus on creating network graphs of host and archival countries to

            <h3>Miscellanious</h3>
            <p class="text">
             In general, I did not have to clean up the data much. There were only small differences between datasets that I had noted. 
              In my exploratory analysis of the data, I noted that Cohort 1 had “Ephemera” as a material type, but later cohorts did not. 
              However, I did not continue to work with the material types so I did not address this. In my work to prepare the data for the 
              network graphs and computing more statistics, I removed NaN values at the bottom of some of the application datasets using dataframe 
              indexing in Python. One cell in Cohort 2’s dataset used “México” while all other instances used “Mexico”, so I standardized the spelling 
              across datasets. Other examples were fixing “Nigeria” was entered as “NIgeria” in one cell, and similarly standardizing “Republic of 
              Congo” and “Republic of the Congo”. I made these small changes in Excel.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Cohort 5 Data</h3>
            <p class="text"> 
            Because we received the Cohort 5 application data towards the end of Spring Quarter, more data processing had to be done for that dataset. 
            The dataset already contained detailed regions such as Southeast Asia and Latin America, but the data from other cohorts only had the more general “Americas” and “Asia”. 
            I had already created the network graphs for the previous cohorts and written code to calculate their statistics, so to make my
            visualizations uniform and to be able to use the same network preparation code that I had written, I added in the more general host and archival regions to the data. 
            I also standardized the country names as some were written in the country's native language which some viewers might not understand. 
            I also added a Host Country column based on the host institution recorded in the data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Prepping for Network Graphs</h3>
            <p class="text"> 
            I used gephi to create the network graphs. To do this, I had to transform the data into “nodes” and “edges” files. 
              The nodes files contain the country names as a label, a number assigned to it as an ID, and any other attributes to 
              categorize the countries. The edges files contain source IDs, target IDs, and the types of connections between them. 
              I had to change the data from country names to unique number identifiers and show the relationship between host and 
              archival country using these number IDs. To do this, I used the Pandas library in Python again. I created a masterlist of 
              nodes by creating a list of every unique host and archival country and looping through it to create a dictionary of countries 
              and their IDs. I also created a dictionary matching each country to its region. At first, I just created one node .csv file 
              for all cohorts using the node dictionary, but that gave me issues when exporting the graphs to be embedded into a website.
              All the nodes would appear on the graph when exported, even when nodes not present in the particular cohort had been filtered
              out in the gephi software. So, I kept the nodes dictionary but created separate node files for each cohort using a similar 
              process as when creating the masterlist. These node files included region as an attribute so I could color-code the graphs 
              by region.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text"> 
            To create each edge file per cohort, I looped through each country in the Host Country and Archival Country columns of the dataframes,
              checked for that country’s ID in the node dictionary, and appended the ID value to a list. I then wrote the list of host IDs, the 
              list of archival IDs, and a list filled with the string ‘Directed’ into three columns in a .csv file. This is because each connection 
              was directed, an application from one host country to fund work in an archival country. 
            </p>

            <h3>Gathering Application Data Statistics</h3>
            <p class="text">
            Aside from preparing the data for gephi, I also used Python to gather statistics on total applications, funded applications, 
              applications which were invited for detailed, applications by region, and applications where the host and archival country 
              were the same and vice versa. To get applications by region, I simply looped through the “Host Region” columns of the dataframes. 
              To get applications which were invited for detailed, I copied the original cohort application dataframe and dropped rows which were 
              False in the “Invited for Detailed” column. To check whether the host and archival countries were the same, I applied a function to
              each dataframe which created a new column stating True if they were the same and False if not.

            <p class="text">
            Much of the data processing done in Python, especially computing the statistics, was quite rudimentary. I just wanted 
            to get the job done initially. However, I am looking to make the code more efficient now that I have created my graphs 
              and computed the statistics. I will add how I changed the code to make it more robust in the future below.

            <p class="text">
            After importing the nodes and edges files into gephi, it initially looks like this:

            <p class="text">
            I classified each node by color in terms of region, and each edge (line) is colored the same as the host country. 
              The size of each node reflects its out-degree, that is how many applications the country has made. The size of the label 
              of the country name also reflects this. Nodes with lines connecting them indicates a relationship between a host country 
              and an archival country in an application. Nodes that do not have any lines represent countries that are both host and 
              archival in their application(s). I chose the Fruchtermann Reingold layout as it shows the networks most clearly and simply.

              The original and unchanged exported graphs look like this when hosted on a website:

               To make it more readable, I changed some parts of the .js and .json files that were generated by the plugin. 
                I made the labels more visible, allowed variation in the sizes of the nodes and edges, and formatted the
                text on the left.

            I had played around with potentially identifying host institutions on my network graphs. However, 
              I could not find a good way to do this on gephi. I attempted to add the host institution as another column in the 
              nodes .csv file, but the only way I could display them resulted in a cluttered and unreadable visualization, especially
              in the case of Brazil which had multiple host institutions in Cohort 2:

            <br>
            
            <p class="text">
            I attempted to export the graph as an SVG file and move around the host institution names, but it was still quite messy 
              so I decided not to include it and use other tools to hopefully display this data better.

             I also thought that being able to highlight which applications were funded on the visualization would be useful, but 
             I was not able to implement this either which is why I created separate visualizations for only the funded applications. 
             This is because I am only able to add attribute columns in the nodes file, and the nodes file contains one of every unique 
             country and its number ID. So, there was no way to really add in a “Funded” column which would be accurate.

             Finally, I prefer the look of the visualizations in gephi the most. I thought that the style and functionalities 
              would be preserved when embedding the graphs into a website. One limitation of embedding the graphs in a site is that
              the arrows showing the direction of host country to archival country are missing. In these cases, the viewer can use the
              size difference of the nodes or can infer based on the countries which one is which. Although the visualizations 
              look the most aesthetically pleasing to me in gephi, I believe that they can still be clearly read and analyzed when
              embedded in a website.

            Some obvious patterns can be seen across cohorts, such as the United States sending the most applications in each cohort 
             and having multiple being funded each year. A majority of applications every year come from countries which 
          are both host and archival. Cohort 4 was the only year where applications from the Americas were not the 
            majority being funded (applications from Africa were). Oceania consistently sends the least amount of 
             applications.
